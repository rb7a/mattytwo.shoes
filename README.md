### Hi there 👋

My name is Matthew and I'm part of the Data Team at [NZZ](https://www.nzz.ch "Neue Zürcher Zeitung").

I fall into a self-titled category called the "Full-Stack Analyst" and have experience across a range of topics:
- Requirements Engineering & Business Analysis
- AGILE methodology and principles (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Analytics tools like Mixpanel, Heap Analytics, Google Analytics, Piwik/Matomo, Adobe Analytics, Webtrends
- Tag Management Systems (TMS) like Google Tag Manager, Ensighten, Tealium iQ
- Frontend technologies (React, Vue, etc.)
- Programming languages (HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, RegEx)
- SQL queries (mostly PostgreSQL, BigQuery and MySQL flavours)
- BigQuery / Google Cloud Storage understanding
- Database architecture and design (schemas, primary/-foreign keys, etc.)

In general, I have high tech-literacy and a service mindset. I will do anything to please my customers, whether they are internal employees or end-users of the platform I am working on!

You can find more about me on my personal website [mattytwoshoes](http://mattytwo.shoes "mattytwo.shoes - my personal site")

Come watch me livestream regulary on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/matty_twoshoes "my Twitch channel") twice a week!

⚡ Fun fact: I have only lived in countries with 🟥red and ⬜white flags. Can you guess which ones?
